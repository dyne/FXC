The "FXC" cryptographic protocol is used to split a secret string in multiple parts and to recover it using some of these parts (quorum). An functional application demonstrating its functionality is available at <a href="https://secrets.dyne.org">secrets.dyne.org

The FXC protocol and its use case (mostly related to social digital currency) are explained in this document [Implementation of digital social currency infrastructure (D5.5)](http://dcentproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/D5.5-Implementation-of-digital-social-currency-infrastructure-.pdf) produced as part of the research conducted in the [D-CENT project](http://dcentproject.eu).

# Usage

```clojure
(require 'fxc.core)
(def secret (fxc.core/generate :url 32))
(def shares (fxc.core/encode fxc.core/settings secret))
(fxc.core/decode fxc.core/settings shares)
```

Default configuration settings:
```clojure
{:salt "La gatta sul tetto che scotta",
 :description "FXC v1 (Simple Secret Sharing, Freecoin component)",
 :protocol "FXC1", :alphabet "ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789",
 :quorum 3,
 :prime prime4096,
 :type "WEB",
 :total 5,
 :max 1024,
 :length 6,
 :entropy 3.1}
```

Public functions:

- Encode
```clojure
fxc.core/encode
([conf pass])
  Takes a string and returns multiple strings that can be used to
  retrieve the original according to settings.
```
- Decode
```clojure
fxc.core/decode
([conf slices])
  Takes a collection of strings and returns the original secret
  according to the settings.
```
- Generate
```clojure
fxc.core/generate
([type size])
  Generates a random password of type and size. Available types
  are :bytes :base64 :base32 :hex and :url
```

The [Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing) algorithm adopted is based on [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing), references:
- Shamir, Adi (1979), "How to share a secret", Communications of the ACM 22 (11): 612â€“613

The implementation used is by Tim Tiemens with a 4096 cipher prime number. The Integer Compression algorithm used internally is the FastPFOR128 by Daniel Lemire, see: Lemire, D. and Boytsov, L. "[Decoding billions of integers per second through vectorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2137)" (2015).
